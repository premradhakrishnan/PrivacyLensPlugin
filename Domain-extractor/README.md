# PrivacyLens plugin

Extracts domain names of all the results of a Google search query, also removes duplicates. 

Open the popup to see the extracted links.


Enhancements: 
- Removed all google domains and its subdomains since these are present on all search results by default and is not relevant to our analyses. Also removed youtube. 
- Added favicons (dynamically generated from https://t2.gstatic.com/faviconV2?client=SOCIAL&type=FAVICON&fallback_opts=TYPE,SIZE,URL&url=http://wikipedia.com&size=64) with the domain names to make the UI more visually appealing. 
- Made the plugin compact to minimize scrolling for the users.
